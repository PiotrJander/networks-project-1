super simple:
* last, a test suite
* create a bunch of clients in time intervals
* see if server works based on client output
* maybe debug the two client case now
* uncomment real world cases



* don't broadcast to self
* first reproduce bug, then fix it


* why no response??
* clients list pointer



strange, we send but client gets no response

somewhere along the way we lost echo ability

try reversing
